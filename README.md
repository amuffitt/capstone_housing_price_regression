# Background
This was the first Capstone project done as part of the Data Analytics Career Track program at Springboard (designed in partnership with Microsoft).  It involved finding a dataset and then running various analyses such as descriptive stats, correlation, and regression to learn more about the data and potentially model it for the future.

I chose a dataset involving King County, WA real estate sales because the real estate market is interesting to me and I lived in the general area during the timeframe collected (2014-2015) which made it particularly relevant on a personal level.  

Understanding current real estate data and developing a prediction model could  theoretically enable real estate agents in King County WA to predict housing prices and understand what factors most influence those housing prices to properly advise clients, minimize time on market, and maximize their related commissions.

Ultimately this project involved:
- Creating a predictive pricing model from King County, WA housing data using multiple linear regression that resulted in a .63 R Square (63.2% of price variability is explained by the chosen input variables)
- Showing model formation process using descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visual techniques like scatterplots, box plots, and histograms, and statistical correlation to select appropriate input variables to model


# Dataset
The data is from a Kaggle.com dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction and consists of 21k+ county house sale records from May 2014 - May 2015.  


# Tools 

The analysis for this project was done in Excel using the Data Analysis ToolPak (that can be easily installed as an add-on in Excel) utlilizing the Descriptive Statistics, Correlation, and Regression features, and different Excel chart options were used to visualize the data.   In addition, Tableau geo map charts were utilized to show county housing price and lot size variation.
